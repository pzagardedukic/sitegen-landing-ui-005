/*
 * Applying a fixture patch to website.json.
 *
 * A fixture is a patch, not a copy: a copy of the whole file would go stale the moment the
 * schema moves, and it would hide what the variant is actually testing. `null` deletes the
 * key — that is how "the customer uploaded no logo" is expressed. Arrays replace whole,
 * because a half-merged list of services is not a thing anyone means.
