/*
 * Lumiera's floating header: a pill inset from the top and both sides, laid out as three
 * columns — navigation on the left, logo in the centre, language on the right. The outer
 * columns are equal (`1fr auto 1fr`), so the logo sits on the true centre of the page
 * whatever width the navigation and the language pill happen to have.
 *
 * Two states, both drawn in Figma:
 *   - over the banner photograph (every page opens on one): frosted glass — white at 6 %,
 *     a white hairline, a 16px background blur — with white type;
 *   - once the page moves: solid, on the Lumiera hairline, with the text colour. This is
 *     the "brez banner slike" frame, which is also what the pill must look like over white
 *     sections, where white type would vanish.
 *
 * The children read the state through inherited `color` and two custom properties rather
 * than a prop: `--logo-filter` turns a customer's logo artwork white over the photograph,
 * `--pill-border` gives the language pill its hairline once the bar is solid.
 *
 * The AppBar itself is transparent to the pointer; only the pill takes clicks, so the page
 * in the gap above and beside it stays usable.
