 * sections (SolidDivider). The Figma has no such band: sections stack on the page
 * background, and the spacing comes from the section padding. The band also had a fixed
 * background attachment, which parallaxed on desktop and juddered on iOS.
 *
 * The section list and its enablement conditions are untouched — only the separator is gone,
 * so `disableTopDivider` / `disableBottomDivider` no longer have anything to switch off.
